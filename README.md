  # $${\color{blue} \textbf{DevOps Tools}}$$


- DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. 

- Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.

- DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.


- **key aspects of DevOps:**
 1. Collaboration and Communication
 2. Automation
 3. Continuous Integration (CI)
 4. Continuous Delivery (CD)
 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
 6. Monitoring and Logging
 7. Cultural Shift
 8. Tools and Technologies

# $${\color{red} \textbf{git}}$$

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of their projects efficiently.

# $${\color{green} \textbf{Terraform}}$$

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to build, modify, and version cloud and on-premises resources in a safe and efficient manner.

# $${\color{voilet} \textbf{Ansible}}$$

Ansible can be used to deploy the software on different servers at a time without human interaction. Ansible can also be used to configure the servers and create user accounts. Ansible is an agent-less software which means there is no need to install the software in the nodes which means you need to do the SSH to connect the nodes to perform the required operations on the servers.

# $${\color{grey} \textbf{Docker}}$$

Docker is an open-source containerization platform by which you can pack your application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container. Containers are light in weight which makes them portable and they are isolated from the underlying infrastructure and from each other container. You can run the docker image as a docker container in any machine where docker is installed without depending on the operating system.

# $${\color{green} \textbf{Kubernetes}}$$

- Kubernetes is an open-source Container Management tool that automates container deployment, container scaling, descaling, and container load balancing (also called a container orchestration tool).

- It is written in Golang and has a vast community because it was first developed by Google and later donated to CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).

- Kubernetes can group ‘n’ number of containers into one logical unit for managing and deploying them easily.

- Kubernetes to manage microservices applications.

- Multiple numbers of containers run on multiple hosts at a time.
