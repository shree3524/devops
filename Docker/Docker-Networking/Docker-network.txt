Docker Network
DOCKER network drivers or docker network types
bridge - to connect two different networks , create bridge between two diff networks.
(eg communication between host and docker container is possible because of bridge)
overlay - to communicate two containers that are present in two seprate networks(hosts) using
docker swarm.
none -  doesnt have any ip attached to it to keep your container completely isolated and 
ensure this container is kept as a backup container.
host -  the container will get host ip that is localhost ip 
macvlan - to give physical identity , to make appear as physical ,allocating physical
address to container
IPvlan - we use this network to provide ipv4 and ipv6 addresss of our choice or
assign customize ip to container,i.e take control over ipv4 or ipv6 assigning.

Dockernetwork commands
docker network create --subnet "192.168.0.0/16" --driver bridge newnetwork 
docker network ls 
docker run -d -P --network newnetwork nginx
docker run -d -p --network host httpd
